\chapter*{Abstract}

Modern web servers use various techniques to achieve high performance. Every web server applications use a thread pool to distribute the workload. Performance of such servers are highly dependent on the number of threads in the worker thread pool. The optimal thread pool size is dependent on multiple factors. Type of workload (nature of
user application/ implementation) is one key factor of that. This paper propose a technique to identify optimal thread pool size for the user program based on the program features using a machine learning approach.
