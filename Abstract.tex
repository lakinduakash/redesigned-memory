\chapter*{Abstract}

Web server optimization is important for businesses since web servers can achieve higher performance consuming less resources. This research present optimization techniques for different program types based IO characteristics. Several web server architectures are implemented in Ballerina and then tuned. Performance of each server architecture and tunes are evaluated against different types of program where CPU and IO intensive features are prominent in each program. For further tuning thread pool size is selected based on experimental results. Then optimal thread pool size is identified for each set of programming features where features are different types of remote IO calls. Since IO calls are part of the native representation of ballerina, a parser is implemented to extract these features automatically from Abstract Syntax Tree of the Ballerina source code. Finally, a machine learning model is proposed where optimal thread pool size is the output of given set of programming features. Finally, it could be observers that for different program types, the latency when the optimal thread pool size suggested by the ML approach is used is lower than the latency when Ballerina's default thread pool size is used.
