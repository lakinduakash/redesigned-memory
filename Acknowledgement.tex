\chapter*{Acknowledgment}


Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor \textbf{Dr.
Chamath Keppetiyagama} and my co-supervisor \textbf{Dr. Malith Jayasinghe} for
the continued support of my study for whole one year, their patience, motivation and
immense knowledge. Their guidance allowed me to improve my thinking, writing
and presenting skills.
Besides my supervisors, I would like to thank \textbf{Ms. Duneesha Fernando} for
reviewing my work, supporting to write this thesis and organizing meetings in order
to bring this study up to this level.
Also, my sincere thanks go to my batch-mates who helped to succeed in this
project by allowing me to discuss problems arisen while continuing this research.
Last but not least, I would like to thank my family members who supported
me in all other ways in my hard times.
